### 👨‍💻 How I Work
I don't start work without the necessary tools and information to execute the job. Therefore, you won't be spending money on me while waiting for access to your project's repository or that development database.

That famous **ownership mentality**, I truly believe in it. As an independent developer and entrepreneur, I understand its importance very well. I don't see it as a negative thing, so go ahead and throw on the shirt of your company/project, and let's get to work!

Feeling a bit lost on how to grow your app? Unsure about whether to do this or that? Don't even have the app and wondering about its technological viability? **No problem!** I am a developer, but I have worked (and still do, to be honest) in consulting. So, more than just a developer, I have the awareness and soft skills of a systems and projects analyst, business rule validation, and a good sense of UI/UX.

Obviously, I'm not perfect and have flaws. You might even find me a bit arrogant up to this point, and you may be right. But in day-to-day interactions, you can rely on me and my resilience. I struggle with team management, so if the demand involves leading one or more beyond myself, I'm not the guy for you. If the demand is less technical, I don't feel comfortable in that role, so my performance might be subpar. And I don't handle senseless resistance well, so I make my points very clear.
